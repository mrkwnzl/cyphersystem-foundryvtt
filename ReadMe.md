This is a game system for the Cypher System family of games (Cypher System, Numenera, The Strange, Predation, Unmasked, Gods of the Fall, Vurt, Shotguns & Sorcery) by [Monte Cook Games](https://www.montecookgames.com) and others.

At its core, this system is just a rather simple digital character sheet. Included are dice macros for the usual rolls in Cypher games. Macros allow for customization of the macro bar and even customization of the macros themselves to use the Cypher system exactly like you need. This allows players and GMs to use any rules interpretation and house rule they could use at a physical table. If you can do it at the table, you can do it with this system! In addition, a pre-made tabletop scene and some tokens that can be used as markers are included in the system, so that your game is ready in a few minutes.

## Highlights

- Support for Numenera and any Cypher System game (including Unmasked, Predation, and Gods of the Fall).
- An Unmasked mode in which you can switch between your Teen Form and Mask Form.
- An optional additional text field for your character sentence. You can use it for the Domain in Gods of the Fall, or to note down the flavor of your Type.
- Optional Power Shifts, including additional checkboxes for 1 Action Recovery Rolls. Handy for every superhero game, Gods of the Fall, or the Setting in Stay Alive!. The Power Shifts can be renamed to anything you like.
- An option for an additional pool, for people with the Luck Descriptor or the Datasphere in Numenera. This pool can be renamed to anything you like.
- A robust pre-made macro system which you can use to customize the game for your own needs.
- A pre-made scene of a tabletop. Play just like you do at a physical table!
- The Cypher System for Foundry VTT is available in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish.
