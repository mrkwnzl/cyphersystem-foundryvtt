CYPHER SYSTEM OPEN LICENSE

This license (the “Agreement”) is an agreement between a publisher or author (“You”) and Monte Cook Games, LLC (“MCG”), that grants You a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to publish and distribute tabletop roleplaying game materials (the “Work”) based on and incorporating the Cypher System Reference Document (“CSRD”) and declaring compatibility with the Cypher System. By including the words “Compatible with the Cypher System” on the cover of the Work, or by including the “Compatible with the Cypher System” logo on the cover of the work, or by including these items on or in any advertising, promotions, press releases, or other documents affiliated with the Work, You indicate Your acceptance of the terms of this Agreement.

The Work may include any or all text included in the CSRD. It may not include text, art, or other content from other MCG publications. MCG may publish updated versions of the CSRD. You may use any authorized version of the CSRD in the Work.

The Work must include the phrase “Compatible with the Cypher System” or the “Compatible with the Cypher System” logo on the cover of the Work. And it must include within the Work, wherever the Work otherwise lists legal and copyright information, the following text:

This product is an independent production and is not affiliated with Monte Cook Games, LLC. It is published under the Cypher System Open License, found at http://csol.montecookgames.com.

CYPHER SYSTEM and its logo are trademarks of Monte Cook Games, LLC in the U.S.A. and other countries. All Monte Cook Games characters and character names, and the distinctive likenesses thereof, are trademarks of Monte Cook Games, LLC. 

The Work may not use or incorporate the Cypher System logo, the MCG logo, or any other trademark of MCG, except the “Compatible with the Cypher System” logo.

You may use any authorized version of the “Compatible with the Cypher System” logo. You may not crop or alter the logo in any way, except to resize it proportionally.

You may not market or advertise the Work using the name of any contributor unless You have written permission from the contributor to do so. 

Other than to acknowledge that the Work is produced and distributed under this Agreement, neither the Work nor any advertising, promotions, press releases, or other documents affiliated with the Work may contain any claim that You or the Work has been sanctioned or approved by MCG, or is affiliated with MCG in any way.

Neither the Work nor any advertising, promotions, press releases, or other documents affiliated with the Work may contain racist, homophobic, discriminatory, or other repugnant views; overt political agendas or views; depictions or descriptions of criminal violence against children; rape or other acts of criminal perversion; or other obscene material.

The Work may not infringe, wrongfully use, or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party. You hereby indemnify MCG and undertake to defend MCG against and hold MCG harmless from any claims, suits, loss, and damages arising out of alleged infringement, wrongful use, or misappropriation of any third party’s intellectual property by the Work. The indemnification obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

MCG takes no responsibility for the Work. You agree to hold MCG and its officers, partners, and employees harmless in the event that Your publication of the Work results in legal action.

The CSRD, the “Compatible with the Cypher System” logo, the Cypher System logo, the MCG logo, and all other trademarks of MCG belong solely and exclusively to MCG.

If You breach any of the terms of this Agreement, it results in automatic termination of the Agreement. Unless the breach is cured to MCG’s sole satisfaction and such cure is documented by a written agreement between You and MCG within 15 days of breach, You must immediately recall and destroy all existing copies of the Work. You may additionally be subject to damages as a result of breach.

This Agreement shall be construed and governed by the laws of the State of Washington and the laws of the United States. With regard to any disputes arising under this Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Washington and the United States.
